// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

	//Variable called sum = num1 + num2
	//num1 = user input or predefined number
	//num2 = user input or predefined number
	//PRINT sum variable

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

	//num = user INPUT or predetermined number
	//IF (num MOD 2) == 0
		//PRINT number is even
	//ELSE
		//PRINT number is odd
	
// Exercise 3: Write psuedo code that will perform the following.

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

	//have user INPUT 5 numbers
	//add numbers together and divide by 5 and set to variable named averageNum
	//find the MIN() and MAX() of the 5 numbers entered by the user and set to variable named minNumber and maxNumber
	//PRINT variable averageNum + ": This is the average of your five numbers."
	//PRINT variable minNumber + ": This is the smallest number you entered."
	//PRINT variable maxNumber + ": This is the biggest number you entered."
